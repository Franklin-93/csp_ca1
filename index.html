        Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster and the Eastern and Midland Region. It is bordered on the south by the
        Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range. At the 2016 census, it had an urban area population of
        1,173,179, while the population of the traditional County Dublin as a whole was 1,347,359. The population

         <h2>  Population</h2>
         <p>There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where and when Dublin originated, with a settlement
            established by the Gaels during or before the 7th century CE, and a second, Viking, settlement, following.
            As the small Kingdom of Dublin, the city grew, and it became Ireland's principal settlement following the Norman
            invasion. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest city in the
            British Empire after the Acts of Union in 1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the
            Irish Free State, later renamed Ireland in 1937</p>
