                <h2><a name="dublin_city"></a>Dublin</h2>
                
                <!-- PARAHRAPH number 1,2,3-->

                <P class="city"> Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Situated on a bay on the east
                    coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster and the Eastern and
                    Midland Region. It is bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains
                    range. At the 2016 census, it had an urban area population of 1,173,179, while the population of the
                    traditional County Dublin as a whole was 1,347,359. The population of the Greater Dublin Area was
                    1,904,806.</P>

                <p>There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where and when Dublin originated, with a
                    settlement established by the Gaels during or before the 7th century CE, and a second, Viking,
                    settlement, following. As the small Kingdom of Dublin, the city grew, and it became Ireland's
                    principal settlement following the Norman invasion. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th
                    century and was briefly the second largest city in the British Empire after the Acts of Union in
                    1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, later
                    renamed Ireland in 1937.
                </p>

                <p> Dublin is a contemporary and historical centre for Irish education, arts and culture, administration
                    and industry. As of 2018 the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network
                    (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty
                    cities in the world.

                    <h2><a name="transport"></a>Transport</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Road</h3> <!-- Road section-->            
                    <p>The road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The M50 motorway, a semi-ring road
                        which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary
                        routes to the rest of the country. In 2008, the West-Link toll bridge was replaced by the eFlow
                        barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car
                        pre-registration.
                    </p>

                    <p>The first phase of a proposed eastern bypass for the city is the Dublin Port Tunnel, which
                        officially opened in 2006 to mainly cater for heavy vehicles. The tunnel connects Dublin Port
                        and the M1 motorway close to Dublin Airport. The city is also surrounded by an inner and outer
                        orbital route. The inner orbital route runs approximately around the heart of the Georgian city
                        and the outer orbital route runs primarily along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two
                        canals, the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal, as well as the North and South Circular Roads.
                    </p>

                    <p>The 2016 TomTom Traffic Index ranked Dublin the 15th most congested city in the world and the 7th
                        most congested in Europe.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bus</h3> <!-- Bus section-->
                    <p>Dublin is served by a network of nearly 200 bus routes which cover the city and suburbs. The
                        majority of these are provided by Dublin Bus, with a modest number having been transferred to Go
                        Ahead Ireland in 2018. A number of smaller companies also operate. Fares are generally
                        calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled. There are several different levels of
                        fares, which apply on most services. A "Real Time Passenger Information" system was introduced
                        at Dublin Bus bus stops in 2012 in which signs relay display the projected time of the next
                        buses' arrival based on its GPS position. The National Transport Authority is responsible for
                        integration of bus and rail services in Dublin and has been involved in introducing a pre-paid
                        smart card, called a Leap card, which can be used on all of Dublin's public transport services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cycling</h3> <!-- Cycling section-->
                    <p>The 2011 Census showed that 5.9 percent of commuters in Dublin cycled. A 2013 report by Dublin
                        City Council on traffic flows crossing the canals in and out of the city found that just under
                        10% of all traffic was made up of cyclists, representing an increase of 14.1% over 2012 and an
                        87.2% increase over 2006 levels and is attributed to measures, such as, the Dublinbikes bike
                        rental scheme, the provision of cycle lanes, public awareness campaigns to promote cycling and
                        the introduction of the 30 km/h city centre speed limit.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p>Dublin City Council began installing cycle lanes and tracks throughout the city in the 1990s, and
                        as of 2012 the city had over 200 kilometres (120 mi) of specific on- and off-road tracks for
                        cyclists. In 2011, the city was ranked 9th of major world cities on the Copenhagenize Index of
                        Bicycle-Friendly Cities. The same index showed a fall to 15th in 2015, and Dublin was outside
                        the top 20 in 2017.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p>Dublinbikes is a self-service bicycle rental scheme which has been in operation in Dublin since
                        2009. Sponsored by JCDecaux and Just Eat, the scheme consists of hundreds of unisex bicycles
                        stationed at 44 terminals throughout the city centre. Users must make a subscription for either
                        an annual Long Term Hire Card or purchase a three-day ticket. As of 2018, Dublinbikes had over
                        66,000 long-term subscribers making over 2 million journeys per year.

                    <h3>Middle Ages</h3> <!-- Middle ages  section should be -H3-->
                    <p>In 841 the Vikings established a fortified base in Dublin. But Dublin became more established as
                        a Viking settlement in the 10th century and, despite a number of attacks by the native Irish, it
                        remained largely under Viking control until the Norman invasion of Ireland was launched from
                        Wales in 1169 It was upon the death of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn in early 1166 that Ruaidrí Ua
                        Conchobair, King of Connacht, proceeded to Dublin and was inaugurated King of Ireland without
                        opposition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        According to some historians, part of the city's early economic growth is attributed to a trade
                        in slaves.Slavery in Ireland and Dublin reached its pinnacle in the 9th and 10th centuries.
                        Prisoners from slave raids and kidnappings, which captured men, women and children, brought
                        revenue to the Gaelic Irish Sea raiders, as well as to the Vikings who had initiated the
                        practice The victims came from Wales, England, Normandy and beyond.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The King of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, after his exile by Ruaidhrí, enlisted the help of
                        Strongbow, the Earl of Pembroke, to conquer Dublin. Following Mac Murrough's death, Strongbow
                        declared himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city. In response to Strongbow's
                        successful invasion, King Henry II of England affirmed his ultimate sovereignty by mounting a
                        larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself Lord of Ireland. Around this time, the county of
                        the City of Dublin was established along with certain liberties adjacent to the city proper.
                        This continued down to 1840 when the barony of Dublin City was separated from the barony of
                        Dublin. Since 2001, both baronies have been redesignated as the City of Dublin.

                    <h2><a name="climate"></a>Climate</h2>
                    <p>Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a maritime climate with
                        mild-warm summers, cool winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January
                        temperature is 8.8 °C (48 °F), while the average maximum July temperature is 20.2 °C (68 °F). On
                        average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with 76 mm (3
                        in)
                        of rain, and the driest month is February with 46 mm (2 in). Rainfall is evenly distributed
                        throughout the year.
                    </p>

                    <p>Dublin's sheltered location on the east coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving
                        only
                        about half the rainfall of the west coast. Ringsend in the south of the city records the lowest
                        rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of 683 mm (27 in), with the
                        average annual precipitation in the city centre being 714 mm (28 in). The main precipitation in
                        winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common
                        than snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds
                        are most
                        common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location, it is least
                        affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the
                        city
                        colder and more prone to snow showers.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the 20th century, smog and air-pollution were an issue in the city, precipitating a ban on
                        bituminous fuels across Dublin. The ban was implemented in 1990 to address black smoke
                        concentrations, that had been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in residents.
                        Since
                        the ban, non-trauma death rates, respiratory death rates and cardiovascular death rates have
                        declined by an estimated 350 deaths annually.
