                <P class="popul"> Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Situated on a bay on the east
                    coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster and the Eastern and
                    Midland Region. It is bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains
                    range. At the 2016 census, it had an urban area population of 1,173,179, while the population of the
                    traditional County Dublin as a whole was 1,347,359. The population of the Greater Dublin Area was
                    1,904,806.</P>

                <h2> <a name="population"></a> Population</h2>
                <p>There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where and when Dublin originated, with a
                    settlement established by the Gaels during or before the 7th century CE, and a second, Viking,
                    settlement, following. As the small Kingdom of Dublin, the city grew, and it became Ireland's
                    principal settlement following the Norman invasion. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century
                    and was briefly the second largest city in the British Empire after the Acts of Union in 1800.
                    Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, later renamed
                    Ireland in 1937.</p>

                <p>Dublin is a contemporary and historical centre for Irish education, arts and culture, administration
                    and industry. As of 2018 the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network
                    (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty
                    cities in the world.</p>

                <h2><a name="climate"></a>Climate</h2>
                <p>Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a maritime climate with
                    mild-warm summers, cool winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January
                    temperature is 8.8 °C (48 °F), while the average maximum July temperature is 20.2 °C (68 °F). On
                    average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with 76 mm (3 in)
                    of rain, and the driest month is February with 46 mm (2 in). Rainfall is evenly distributed
                    throughout the year.
                </p>

                <p>Dublin's sheltered location on the east coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only
                    about half the rainfall of the west coast. Ringsend in the south of the city records the lowest
                    rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of 683 mm (27 in),[71] with the
                    average annual precipitation in the city centre being 714 mm (28 in). The main precipitation in
                    winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than
                    snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds are most
                    common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location, it is least
                    affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the city
                    colder and more prone to snow showers.
                </p>

                <p>In the 20th century, smog and air-pollution were an issue in the city, precipitating a ban on
                    bituminous fuels across Dublin. The ban was implemented in 1990 to address black smoke
                    concentrations, that had been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in residents. Since
                    the ban, non-trauma death rates, respiratory death rates and cardiovascular death rates have
                    declined – by an estimated 350 deaths annually.
